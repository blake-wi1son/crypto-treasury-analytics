# crypto-treasury-analytics
Full stack analytics engineering project: API extraction, data modeling, automated orchestration and visualization
**Status** Work in Progress

# Goals
- Build an automated data pipeline from APIs to dashboards
- Practice dbt for data transformation
- Create visualizations showing market correlations
- Showcase end-to-end analytics engineering skills

# Current Progress
- [x] Project setup
- [x] API extraction scripts
- [x] Data warehouse setup
- [ ] dbt models
- [ ] Dashboard

# Planned Tech Stack
- Python for data extraction
- Embedded database. Decided to work with duckdb given its simplicity and no cost. Ideally, in a production setting this would be a cloud database.
- SQL transformation layer. Utilizing dbt core with duckdb
- Visualization tool (TBD)
- GitHub Actions for automation

More details to come as I build this out.
